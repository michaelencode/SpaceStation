# SpaceStation Locker Project for Eclipse
- SpaceStation is a locker project that I built out of curiosity and for fun. The goal of this project is to provide a better locker solution for customers, specifically those who use Eclipse. Most of the lockers available in the market do not fit Eclipse very well and their workflows do not fit our business needs, especially when it comes to returning or canceling items.

- As a programmer with experience working in a warehouse environment, I understand the complexities of warehouse workflows, including the complex warranty policies, refrigerant jar swap, etc. With this knowledge, I have designed a better workflow for the locker project to solve this problem.

- The SpaceStation locker project includes interfaces for customers, employees, and administrators. It also features locker maintenance and communication with Eclipse through APIs.

- I hope that this project can help provide a better locker solution for Eclipse customers and improve their overall experience.
